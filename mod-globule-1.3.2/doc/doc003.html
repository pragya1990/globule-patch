<H2><A NAME="htoc5">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="sec:install"></A>Globule Installation</H2>
<P>
Globule adds replication functionality to the Apache web-server. There are
multiple ways to install Globule, Apache and additional optional software.
The normal installation procedure is the all-in-one package under Unix and
Linux (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:install:installer">2.1</A>), or the Windows installer (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:install:winexe">2.2</A>).
</P>
<P>
In a number of special cases, it might be preferable to install Globule by
other means, such as if you want to add replication features to an already
existing Apache installation, you have a minimalistic system without compilers
or you want to rely on installation paths or packaging methodology of your
system. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:install:source">2.3</A> explains how to install Globule by
hand from source, while Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:install:rpm">2.4</A> explains how to install
pre-compiled RPMs. Beware however that installing Globule by hand from
sources or by using pre-compiled RPMs requires:
</P>
<P>
<UL><LI>
that you are knowledgeable enough to edit Apache configuration files by
 hand;
<LI>that you understand how to select the right package based on the
 requirements you have;
<LI>know how to run the auto-configure script <TT>configure</TT> when
 compiling from source.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
After having installed Globule, refer to section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf">3</A> on how to
configure it.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="htoc6">2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="sec:install:installer"></A>
 Unix and Linux All-in-one installation</H3>
<P>
The all-in-one installation is a bundling of Globule and all the necessary
third-party software which installs in a single run.
This facilitates a standardized environment which works on a multitude of
systems. The following software packages are included:
</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=1>
<TR><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>Apache</TD>
<TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>The web-server software.</TD>

</TR></TABLE>
</P>
<P>
The copyright notices of these packages are included in
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="doc008.html#sec:copyrights">A</A>.
</P>
<P>
To obtain maximum portability to different platforms and Linux distributions,
the installer actually compiles the software packages from source.
Installation therefore takes a bit of time, consumes some disk space and
requires supporting software such as C and C++ compilers to be present.
Modern systems should have sufficient amount of resources such that a default
installation on a fully installed distribution can be done within an
acceptable amount of time. Actual time and resource need will vary on your
system, a typical fairly recent system requires between 5 and 15 minutes and
between 100 and 250 MB of (temporary) disk space to install for a full
installation.
</P>
<P>
Downloaded the all-in-one installer from the web-site of Globule, and execute
it as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
wget 'http://www.globule.org/download/installer.sh'
chmod u+x installer.sh
sh ./installer.sh --keep-build
</PRE>
<P>
The all-in-one installer will do the full installation automatically after you
have confirmed certain settings which are probed by the installer. The
end-result after the installation is a fully capable web-server, installed in
an independent, private directory. You are free to choose this directory as
long as it fits the following requirements:
<OL type=1><LI>
the directory is unused and empty or non-existent;
<LI>it resides on a local disk.
</OL>
</P>
<P>
Good alternatives for this directory are <CODE>/usr/local/globule</CODE>,
<CODE>/home/globule</CODE> or <CODE>/opt/globule</CODE> depending on your system. If you
have a desktop system, we suggest you choose the default provided by the
installer, as indicated by the content in the square brackets. Enter nothing
and press return to accept the default.
</P>
<P>
Other questions the installer asks are about checking the probed hostname of
the system and whether or not to include MySQL support. The provided defaults
should be correct. Including MySQL support is recommended, and can co-exist
with a system-wide MySQL. Including MySQL support will install a database
available only from the web-server, but takes a relatively long time to build.
If you want to use a system-wide MySQL or do not need a database you can
answer ``No'' to this question.
</P>
<P>
When the installer script has finished all files are installed in the target
directory that you specified. This directory is named the prefix or
base-directory. A transcript of the installation is written in
<TT><I>basedir</I></TT><TT>/src/installer.log</TT> We advice you to remove the
installer script you just used, to avoid accidental re-use.<BR>
Be aware that if you will later upgrade, entire directories are removed from
this tree. Read the section on upgrading to understand where you can your
files safely.
</P>
<P>
After installation, you should use the <TT>globulectl</TT> script to start not
just the Apache/Globule software, but also the accompanying software:
</P>
<PRE>
<i>basedir</i>/bin/globulectl start
</PRE>
<P>
At this time, the all-in-one installer will not automatically start the
software when the computer is restarted. You can execute the following
script:
</P>
<PRE>
<i>basedir</i>/bin/globulectl installcrontab
</PRE>
<P>
to install a crontab, which is a periodic check whether the web-server is
running, looks really operational and has been restarted since the last time
the <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE> configuration file was updated. If this is not the case
then it will cleanly restart the server.
</P>
<P>
Once the installation is completed, your server will be ready to operate using
a few example documents. To host your own documents, you will have to defined
how and where to replicate (parts of) your web-server. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf">3</A>
describes how to configure your web-server. The configuration of the
web-server is stored for this all-in-one installer in the file
<B><TT><I>basedir</I></TT></B><B><TT>/etc/httpd.conf</TT></B>. Other configuration files
are all located in that same directory.
</P>

<H4>Upgrading your installation</H4>
<P>
The installer script can be used to upgrade the complete installation
(including supporting software) at later times to the most recent release. To
this end, when the installer script finishes, a modified copy of the installer
script is created as <TT><I>basedir</I></TT><TT>/src/installer.sh</TT>. This script,
not the original, should be used to upgrade and should be run with the same
flags as earlier.
</P>
<P>
If in the initial installation the flag <CODE>--keep-build</CODE> was used,
non-updated software packages will be reused in the installation because
intermediate files are kept. This limits the time needed to upgrade, at the
cost of a some extra disk-space.
Subsection&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:install:installer:advanced">2.1</A> states some more flags and
checks that can be made on the system, which are only needed in advanced
setups.
</P>
<P>
Be aware however that during upgrading, the script will <EM>remove</EM> certain
directories and files from the basedir. Only <TT>htdocs</TT>, <TT>htbin</TT>
and directories with dots in them are kept untouched. Directories
<TT>src</TT>, <TT>etc</TT> and <TT>var</TT> are largely kept as is. Other
directories are removed.
</P>
<P>
If you create additional directories to hold files of created
VirtualHosts/web-sites and upgrade, they could be whiped out when you upgrade
because this script will only keep certain directories. This is why
directories with dots in them are never deleted, so you can use the domain
name of the web-site as the directory name to use as DocumentRoot.
</P>
<P>
<EM>To avoid data loss, always backup the whole installation before
upgrading.</EM>
</P>

<H4><A NAME="sec:install:installer:advanced"></A>
 Installer advanced usage and troubleshooting</H4>
<P>
Most users do not need to read this section, and can safely move to
section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf">3</A> on how to configure Globule.
</P>

<H5>Prerequisite software</H5>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>
The installer script is very useful, even if your Linux distribution is
RPM-package based. This because the installer script installs everything
together in a single location with a standard set of features. However, since
it is not tied to the specific distribution you are using, it does not check
on the prerequisite software. Instead it bundles most necessary software
within the installer. In very minimal setups however, such as supplied by
ISPs where even compilers aren't installed, you might need to check whether
the RPMs below are installed on your system.

Depending on your distribution, you might be able to check whether a package
is installed using the command:
</P>
<PRE>
rpm -q <i>package-name</i>
</PRE>

<H5>Tuning of the installer operation</H5> &nbsp;<BR>
<P>
It is not encouraged to install the supporting software of Globule in a
non-standard way, however if you do want to tune the installation, you can use
the flag <TT>--extra-<I>package</I></TT><TT>-config=<I>...</I></TT> to add
additional options to how the <TT>./configure</TT> script is run for a
particular software packages, where package is one of <TT>httpd</TT> for
Apache, <TT>php</TT>, <TT>globule</TT>, <TT>mysql</TT>, <TT>gd</TT> or
<TT>webalizer</TT>.
</P>
<P>
The following other options are user-available:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>-v</TT> or <TT>--verbose</TT><BR>
Verbose operation, will result in more reporting to the console.<BR>
<DT><DD><TT>-n</TT> or <TT>--noupdate</TT><BR>
Do not attempt to retrieve newer software over the Internet (for upgrading
 only, this is the default for first-time installations).
<DT><DD><TT>--keep-build</TT><BR>
Recommended option to keep the compiled objects file in place, instead of
 removing the compiled source directory after installation.
</DL>
</P>
<P>
Lastly there are two other options which can be used only when upgrading,
<TT>--omit-install</TT> allows you to prepare a new version without installing
it. You should also use the <TT>--keep-build switch</TT>. This way you can
keep the server running while compilation of a upgraded version takes place.
Afterwards you can quickly upgrade a version by manually stop the Apache
server using the globulectl command and running the same command, but now with
the <TT>--omit-build</TT> switch. This minimizes down time for important
systems. A typical usage would be:
</P>
<PRE>
cd <i>basedir</i>
./src/installer.sh --keep-build --omit-install
./bin/globulectl stop
./src/installer.sh --keep-build --omit-build
./bin/globulectl start

 Windows installation</H3>

<H4>1. Requirements</H4>
<P>
This explanation assumes that you are using Windows XP with SP2.
</P>
<P>
If possible, please install Apache and Globule with administrator
privileges. You will need to open ports in your firewall, and only
Administrators can do that.
</P>

<H4>2. Run the automated installer</H4>
<P>
The Windows auto-installer for Globule is available as
<A HREF="http://www.globule.org/download/1.3.1/globule-1.3.1.exe">globule-1.3.1.exe</A>.
It contains a full distribution of Apache, so you don't need to install Apache
separately.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="sec:install:win32:step3"></A>
3. Choose which components to install</H4>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin1.png"></P>

<P>
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><B>Apache:</B> this will install the Apache web server. We check
 if a suitable Apache installation was found. If not, Apache will be
 installed. It requires port 80 to be opened in your firewall.<BR>
You can tell Windows to open port 80, the first time Apache is started, by
 choosing 'Unblock' in the Windows Security Alert window.
<DT><DD><B>Globule:</B> the Globule software. This allows the Apache web
 server to automatically replicate its documents to other servers,
 keep replicas consistent, and to transparently redirect users to the
 best replica.
<DT><DD><B>DNS Redirection:</B> this is the only option you really have
 here. DNS redirection facility adds support for UDP requests to
 Apache (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf:dnsredir">3.3</A>). If you don't know what DNS
 redirection is or you don't own your own domain name, then you probably
 don't need DNS redirection at all. Using DNS redirection
 requires that you open port 53 in your firewall.
</DL>
</P>

<H4>4. Choose an install location for Globule</H4>
<P>
The default installation path is
 <TT>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Globule</TT>
if you install as administrator, or
 <TT>C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Globule</TT>
otherwise. You can change this path if you want Globule installed somewhere
else.
</P>

<H4>5. Install Apache</H4>
<P>
If Apache is not already present in your system, then it is going to be
installed now.
</P>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin2.png"></P>

<P>
Click on ``OK'' to start the Apache installer. You will see the following
screens:
</P>
<P>
<UL><LI>
<EM>Apache Welcome Screen</EM>: click ``Next'' to continue.
<LI><EM>Apache License Agreement</EM>: if you accept their terms in the
 license agreement, check the top radio button and click ``Next'' to
 continue.
<LI><EM>Apache Read This First</EM>: after reading, click ``Next'' to continue.
<LI><EM>Apache Server Info</EM>: Apache will now ask you for
 information about your web server. <EM>If you are not sure what to
 fill in here, fill in the values as seen in the screenshot below.</EM>
 Later, when we generate a configuration file for you.
 <UL><LI>
 <EM>Network Domain</EM>: fill in ``localdomain''.
 <LI><EM>Server Name</EM>: fill in ``localhost''.
 <LI><EM>Administrator's Email Address</EM>: fill in your e-mail
 address or ``dummy@globule.org''.
 <LI><EM>Install Apache HTTP Server 2.0 programs and shortcuts
 for</EM>: Choose ``for All Users, on Port 80, as a Service --
 Recommended.''
 </UL>
 <P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin3.png"></P>

<LI><EM>Apache Setup Type</EM>: Choose the ``Typical'' setup type. Then
 click ``Next'' to continue.
<P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin4.png"></P>

<LI><EM>Destination Folder</EM>: choose a location where Apache is
 going to be installed, then click ``Next'' to continue. 
<LI><EM>Ready to Install the Program</EM>: click ``Install'' to start the
 installation of Apache. 
<LI><EM>Installation Completed</EM>: if all went well Apache shows that
 it is successfully installed. Click on ``Finish'' to continue with the
 Globule installation.
</UL>
</P>

<H4>6. Where was Apache installed?</H4>
<P>
If you installed Apache for <EM>Current User only</EM>, Globule will need to
know where Apache was installed. Note that this is not the default way of
installing Apache, but you know what you are doing, right? Specify the
directory where the <TT>bin</TT> and <TT>modules</TT> directories are in, e.g.
<TT>C:\Documents~and~Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Apache Group\Apache2</TT>.
</P>

<H4>7. Stop existing Apache services</H4>
<P>
To be able to install itself, Globule will need to stop the Apache server you
just installed. If you installed Apache in the default way as described above,
just press ``OK''. If you installed Apache yourself with a different service
name (default is 'Apache2'), please stop the Apache service manually or by
using the Apache Service Monitor. If you had Apache installed for Current
User, press CTRL-C in the console window where you started Apache.
</P>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin5.png"></P>


<H4>8. Installation Completed</H4>
<P>
Congratulations, all the software is installed. Now Globule needs to be
configured to be able to use it. Click on ``Finish'' to go to a web-site which
can help you <A HREF="http://www.globeworld.net/">write your configuration
file</A>. You can also manually edit the Apache configuration file in Apache's
conf directory following instructions in section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf">3</A>.
</P>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin5.png"></P>

<P>
When the installation itself has finished, you will be taken to this web-site
to configure your web server when you you click ``OK''.
</P>
<P>
If you kept the default paths unchanged and installed Globule as Admin, then
your configuration file must be located at <A HREF="file:///C:/Program
Files/Apache Group/Apache2/conf/httpd.conf"><TT>C:/Program Files/Apache
Group/Apache2/conf/httpd.conf</TT></A>. If you installed as non-Admin, then it
should be in <TT>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Apache
Group\Apache2\conf\httpd.conf</TT>.
</P>
<P>
You can start/stop your server using the Apache service icon on the bottom
right of your screen. We recommend you use this service icon, which opens the
Apache Monitor rather then the menu items. This because the menu items do not
provide all functionality.
</P>

<H4>9. Configuring your firewall</H4>
<P>
If you are using Windows XP, then you must configure your firewall to allow
your friends to access the server you just installed. Here is how to do it.
</P>
<P>
<UL><LI>
First, you need to know the IP address of your computer. Click on
 '<TT>Start -&gt; Run</TT>', and type '<TT>cmd</TT>'. That will open a shell window.
 Type '<TT>ipconfig</TT>' in it and press enter. You should get output
 looking like the screenshot below. Keep this window open or write
 down the IP address.
</UL>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin6.jpg"></P>

<UL><LI>
You can now configure your firewall to allow HTTP requests to
 enter your system. Click '<TT>Start -&gt; Run</TT>', then type in
 '<TT>control netconnections</TT>' and click 'OK.' Select the network
 device you use to connect to the Internet (e.g. Local Area
 Connection), then click '<TT>Properties</TT>', and the '<TT>Advanced</TT>'
 tab.<BR>
<BR>
Click on the '<TT>Settings...</TT>' button, and enable protect my computer
 if needed. Click on the '<TT>Advanced</TT>' tab.<BR>
<BR>
In the list of Services check '<TT>Web Server (HTTP)</TT>'. A window
 should pop up (or click on <TT>edit</TT>). Fill in the IP address you
 got from the first steps and click '<TT>OK</TT>'. If you do not see
 '<TT>Web Server (HTTP)</TT>' then select the '<TT>Add..</TT>' button, fill
 in the service name, your IP address and '80' for both external and
 internal port.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>If you enabled DNS redirection in
 <A HREF="#sec:install:win32:step3">step 3</A>, then you must also allow
 DNS requests to enter your system. Click the '<TT>Add...</TT>' button.
 Fill in the service name "DNS" and your IP address where requested,
 and the other fields as seen in the screenshot below.
 <EM>Note that '<TT>UDP</TT></EM><EM>' is checked and '<TT>TCP</TT></EM><EM>' is unchecked.</EM>
</UL>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="glowin7.jpg"></P>

<UL><LI>
Congratulations, you have configured your firewall. From now on,
 any user connected to the Internet can access your Globule server.
</UL>
</P>
<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H3><A NAME="htoc8">2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="sec:install:source"></A>
 Source distribution</H3>
<P>
This section is intended for people with some experience in compiling
programs. Compilation from source allows you to make the best
match with your system, tune the installation and allows for special demands.
This is especially suited for package builders and somewhat experienced system
administrators.<BR>
To compile Globule under Windows you will have to
<A HREF="mailto:globule@globule.org">contact us</A>.
</P>
<P>
Before starting to build Globule from source you have to check the
requirements and determine whether your installation needs to do DNS-based
redirection.
</P>
<P>
<EM>First</EM> determine if you might want to do DNS redirection. DNS
redirection allows clients to be redirected at the DNS level to one of the
available replica servers (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf:dnsredir">3.3</A> for more
information on HTTP vs. DNS redirection). This is the fastest, more
distributed and most transparent redirection method available. It does
however require Globule and Apache to act as an DNS server, which is only
possible if you run a slightly modified Apache server, which requires
recompiling Apache also.
</P>
<P>
Other requirements:
<UL><LI>
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/">A</A>pache version 2.0.50 or higher.
 Note that versions 2.1 and 2.2.x are not yet supported;
<LI>Apache running with a worker or prefork MPM, with dynamic modules
 enabled (these are defaults);
<LI><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc and g++</A> version 3.2 or better.
 There are known problems with gcc 3.4.0, gcc-4.0.x is known to work; 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/software/make/">gmake</A> version 3.79.1 or
 better.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
You should also preferably install Apache from source. If you want to install
Apache from RPMs and require DNS redirection then you <EM>must</EM> use our
supplied RPMs which include the patch. If using RPMs not provided by us, make
sure you also install the developer packages for Apache and APR (httpd-devel
and apr-devel).
</P>
<P>
Because Globule is a module for Apache, you should install Apache first,
following the guidelines in the next section.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="htoc9">2.3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apache installation from source</H4>
<P>
Apache can be set-up, configured and extended through modules in a multitude
of fashions. These, even in an environment without Globule can clash, lead to
security issues, or other issues. It is therefore prudent for us to give some
advice on which configuration of Apache is known to work. Globule is also
known to work with the Apache installation from the major Linux distributions.
</P>
<P>
To install Apache from source download Apache from:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="http://www.globule.org/download/apache-2.0.55/httpd-2.0.55.tar.gz">httpd-2.0.55.tar.gz</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
Unpack the downloaded distribution:
</P>
<PRE>
gzip -c -d &lt; httpd-2.0.55.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd httpd-2.0.55
</PRE>
<P>
If you decided to enable DNS redirection in your server, then you need to
patch your Apache source tree <EM>before</EM> configuring and compiling it. The
patch file is distributed in the
<A HREF="http://www.globule.org/download/1.3.1/mod-globule-1.3.1.tar.gz">mod-globule-1.3.1.tar.gz</A>
Globule source package as file <TT>udp-requests-httpd-2.0.55.patch</TT>.
Copy this file from the Globule archive into the Apache source tree and then
execute:
</P>
<PRE>
patch -p0 &lt; udp-requests-httpd-2.0.55.patch
</PRE>
<P>
Then configure and compile Apache according to the
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/install.html">Apache documentation</A>.
The minimum you should specify is the <TT>--enable-so</TT> option to allow
extension of Apache with modules. We however recommend the following sequence
on the configuration script:
</P>
<PRE>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/globule --enable-auth-anon=shared 
    --enable-auth-dbm=shared --enable-cache=shared --enable-file-cache=shared 
    --enable-disk-cache=shared --enable-mem-cache=shared --enable-example=shared 
   --enable-deflate=shared --enable-ssl --enable-proxy=shared 
   --enable-proxy-ftp=shared --enable-proxy-http=shared 
   --enable-proxy-connect=shared --enable-expires=shared --enable-headers

Then call <CODE>make install</CODE> to compile and install Apache in the designated
target directory as specified by <TT>--prefix</TT>. If the <TT>bin</TT>
directory of this prefix is not in your executable search <CODE>$PATH</CODE>, or
another Apache is installed first then you will need to use either the
<CODE>--with-apache</CODE> or <CODE>--with-apxs</CODE> later when compiling Globule.<BR>
If Apache is installed using a <CODE>--with-layout</CODE> instead of a
<CODE>--prefix</CODE> and/or individual paths have set to split the different items
(such as APR, apr-util and libexec directories) then you are advised to use
the <CODE>--with-apxs</CODE> and <CODE>--with-apr</CODE> flags.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="htoc10">2.3.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="sec:install:php"></A>Globule installation from source</H4>
<P>
To compile Globule from source after having installed Apache with optionally
the DNS redirection patch you can use the compressed tar-archive available at:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="http://www.globule.org/download/1.3.1/mod-globule-1.3.1.tar.gz">mod-globule-1.3.1.tar.gz</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
Unpack this archive, and read the <TT>README</TT>, <TT>INSTALL</TT> and
<TT>NEWS</TT> file for any last-minute release notes that may have been added:
</P>
<PRE>
gzip -c -d &lt; mod-globule-1.3.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd mod-globule-1.3.1
</PRE>
<P>
As usual, first call <CODE>./configure</CODE> as supplied with most open source
projects and available with the standard options. If you however installed
Apache in a non-standard path, then you must specify this path using the
<TT>--with-apache</TT> option when running configure. Note that you must specify
the <EM>root</EM> Apache directory (e.g., <TT>/usr/local/globule</TT>) rather than
the directory where the Apache executable resides (e.g.,
<TT>/usr/local/globule/bin</TT>). If you used the <TT>--prefix</TT> option to
specify a path when installing Apache, then you must use the same path here as
well.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively to the <TT>--with-apache</TT> option, you can also use
<TT>--with-apxs</TT> to specify the absolute path where the <TT>apxs</TT> program is
installed. This file is usually located in the same directory as <TT>httpd</TT>
and <TT>apachectl</TT>:
</P>
<PRE>
./configure --with-apxs=/weird/directory/bin/apxs
</PRE>
<P>
If you want to use DNS redirection, then you must add the
<TT>--enable-dns-redirection</TT> flag to <TT>configure</TT>:
</P>
<PRE>
./configure --with-apache=/usr/local/globule --enable-dns-redirection
</PRE>
<P>
We also recommend to use the <CODE>--enable-globuleadm</CODE>
flag. This installs a set of files in the directory <TT>globuleadm</TT>
inside the directory as indicated by <TT>apxs -q htdocsdir</TT> which allow
you to monitor the operation of Globule.
</P>
<P>
Other options available are:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>--enable-debug</TT><BR>
Compile Globule with debugging symbols and options enabled.
<DT><DD><TT>--enable-optimize</TT><BR>
Use optimization to compile Globule, recommended.
<DT><DD><TT>--enable-profile</TT><BR>
Compile Globule with profiling enabled (not recommended, does not work
 reliably).
<DT><DD><TT>--enable-documentation</TT><BR>
Also build and install documentation (not recommended, read it on-line).
</DL>
</P>
<P>
After running the <TT>./configure</TT> script with the appropriate options,
run ``make'' and ``make install''. This last command will install the Globule
software and also install a sample Globule configuration file named
<TT>httpd-globule.conf</TT> next to the regular <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE> file (in the
directory as specified by <TT>apxs -q sysconfdir</TT>). Use it as an example
of how to configure the <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE> for use with Globule.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="htoc11">2.3.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;PHP installation from source</H4>
<P>
To compile PHP yourself, you must make sure that you instruct PHP with the
configure script to use the apxs2filter as the Apache to PHP hand-off and that
safe mode is enabled. If you install Apache in a non-default path (using the
--prefix option), make sure the PHP is actually configured to use the right
installation of Apache.
</P>
<P>
You should be very aware that the PHP pages will be executed on multiple
servers.
PHP is compiled with certain extensions depending on how it was configured.
If you make your PHP pages depend on a certain set of extensions then all
replica servers should have the same set of extensions. For this reason the
all-in-one installer and Globule Broker System are preferred.
</P>
<P>
The recommended configuration for compilation of PHP is:
</P>
<PRE>
./configure --prefix=$prefix --with-apxs2filter=<i>prefix</i>/bin/apxs --disable-cgi 
            --disable-static --enable-safe-mode --enable-dba --with-dbase --with-gdbm 
            --with-db4 --with-ini --with-flatfile --with-gd=<i>...</i> --enable-ftp 
            --with-mysql=<i>...</i> --with-mysqli=<i>...</i>/bin/mysql_config 
</PRE>
<P>
Where <I>prefix</I> is the base installation path of Apache and
<I>...</I> are the paths to the individual software packages being
referred to, which default to <I>prefix</I> for the use with the all-in-one
installer.
</P>
<P>
When compiling and installing PHP, it will modify your existing
<CODE>httpd.conf</CODE> to add directives to enable PHP parsing. This may not
completely be what you want so save a copy of the original <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>
before your type make install.
</P>
<P>
To add or check whether your PHP is available from within the Apache server,
add the following directives at their proper position in the verb!httpd.conf!,
or check whether all are inserted.
</P>
<P>
<OL type=1><LI>
The PHP module is being loaded using:
<PRE>
LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
</PRE><LI>PHP-based index files are preferred over others. Look at the
 <CODE>DirectoryIndex</CODE> directive in your <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>.
 The alternative <CODE>index.php</CODE> should be the first argument in the
 list.
<LI>Locate other directives named <CODE>AddType</CODE>, the following lines should
 be present:
<PRE>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
</PRE></OL>
</P>
<P>
With these changes, and a restarted server, PHP support is made available to
the Apache web server.

<H3><A NAME="htoc12">2.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="sec:install:rpm"></A>
 Installation from RPMs and alikes</H3>
<P>
We provide also alternative installation methods, which require more
experience with the packages your Linux distribution uses.
</P>
<P>
When using a distribution package, such as the RPMs provided and described
here, you need to select which primary package is needed for your system.
Multiple different RPMs with actual the same software package have to be
provided for if you do want DNS redirection or not, where to install the
software the default location or one in <CODE>/usr/local/</CODE> and which
architecture you have. Most importantly though, RPMs provide no means to make
an initial, working configuration file. You therefore have to locate the
Apache configuration file and modify it by hand.
</P>
<P>
Also the actual installation is scattered in different places
(<TT>/var/www</TT> and <TT>/etc/httpd</TT> for instance), with which you have
to be familiar.
</P>
<P>
If you want to be able to use DNS redirection, you must use an Apache
installation which has the DNS patch applied to it. Default RPM based
distributions do not provide an RPM of Apache with this patch applied therefore
you have to use one of our RPMs. To provide a full service, with up-to-date
Apache web services with a configuration known to work we also provide RPMs
for a plain, distribution system-like Apache installation.
</P>
<P>
If you are using a modern Unix or Linux distribution which uses or can use
RPMs, then you can install Globule from the RPMs as described within this
section. Alternate, less supported binary distributions are available for
Debian and another packed as a tarball. The latter distributions only provide
a basic installation without options such as DNS redirection.<BR>
They can be found on the <A HREF="http://www.globule.org/download/">download</A>
page.
</P>

<H5>1. Requirements</H5>
<P>
You will need a recent Linux distribution (we usually test using recent Redhat 
Fedora or Mandrake distributions). If you have an older (e.g., RedHat 7.2) Linux
version, then we <EM>strongly</EM> recommend that you upgrade. Alternatively,
you can check in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc007.html#sec:trouble">6</A> if and how you can install Globule
on your system.
</P>

<H5>2. Make up your mind</H5>
<P>
At this stage, you must decide whether you want to enable your server to
perform DNS redirection (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf:dnsredir">3.3</A> for more
information on HTTP vs. DNS redirection). If you don't know what DNS
redirection is or you don't own your own domain name, then probably you don't
need DNS redirection at all.
</P>

<H5>3a. If you <EM>do not</EM> want DNS redirection</H5>
<P>
To install Globule you need an recent up-to-date installation of Apache, which
accept dynamic module loading. We provide also Apache RPMs which are known to
work and are similar in functionality and construction as the official Apache
RPMs by RedHat. We however keep more up-to-date and provide the right mix of
modules and settings which co-operate with Globule. Because some platforms
are lacking behind in the update of Apache module it is recommended that you
<EM>uninstall</EM> any standard Apache RPM you may have, and install the RPMs we
provide instead.
</P>
<PRE>
rpm -e --nodeps apache httpd httpd-devel httpd-manual httpd-mmn
rpm -ihv http://www.globule.org/download/apache-2.0.55/httpd-2.0.55-1.i386.rpm
rpm -U http://www.globule.org/download/1.3.1/mod-globule-1.3.1-1.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<H5>3b. If you <EM>do</EM> want DNS redirection</H5>
<P>
Enabling DNS redirection requires that your Apache server can handle UDP
requests. This is not a standard feature of Apache, so you must install the
patched version we provide. First uninstall any Apache RPM you may have, then
install our patched RPM (since this version is solely dedicated to working
with Globule, we package the two of them together):
</P>
<PRE>
rpm -e --nodeps apache httpd httpd-devel httpd-manual httpd-mmn
rpm -U http://www.globule.org/download/1.3.1/globule-1.3.1-1.i386.rpm 
</PRE>

<H5>4. Get started</H5>
<P>
Our RPMs will install Apache and Globule in the default RedHat installation
paths. In particular, you should edit your configuration by opening file
<TT><B>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</B></TT> with your favorite text editor. Please
read Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc004.html#sec:conf:basic">3.1</A> for basic configuration directives.
</P>
<P>
An attractive way is to avoid composing and maintaining the
<TT>httpd.conf</TT> configuration file is to use the Globule Broker System,
which is an automated way to maintain the co-operative relationships between
origin and replica servers and generate their <TT>httpd.conf</TT>
configuration scripts automatically.
</P>
<P>
You can start/stop your server with this command:
</P>
<PRE>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd [start|stop]
</PRE>

<H5>5. Installing Globule RPMs in non-standard directories</H5>
<P>
If you don't want to install your server in the standard RedHat paths (e.g.,
because you want to install Globule side-by-side to an existing Apache
server), then you can use <TT>httpd-local-2.0.50-1.i386.rpm</TT> and
<TT>mod-globule-local-1.3.1-1.i386.rpm</TT> instead of <TT>
httpd-2.0.50-1.i386.rpm</TT> and
<TT>mod-globule-1.3.1-1.i386.rpm</TT>. Apache and Globule will be
installed in directory <TT>/usr/local/globule</TT>. Your configuration file will
be found in <TT>/usr/local/globule/conf/httpd.conf</TT>. To start/stop your
server you must use:
</P>
<PRE>
/usr/local/globule/bin/apachectl [start|stop]
</PRE>

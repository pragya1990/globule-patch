Please report bugs through our Bugzilla web interface, located at:
  http://bugzilla.globule.org/

Version 1.3.1

* Proxy for non-Globule enabled sites

* Much more conservative locking use.

* Replication of dynamic pages (PHP scripts)

* Database query caching.

* Unix all-in-one installer.

* Weighted Round-Robin and Balanced AS-pathlength redirection policies.

* Allow a compressed AS path length file.

* Stability improvements, bug fixes, etcetera (see ChangeLog)

* Documentation review.

* Weighted and balanced based redirection policies.

* Utility programs globuleutil to manage report.log files and convert
  them to standard log files for use with Webalizer.

Version 1.3

* Globule Broker System co-operation.

* Easier upgrading.

* Web interface to view your web site.

* Redesign of internal engine, to improve memory usage.

Version 1.2

* Monitoring extension.

* Disconnected master operation.

* Windows port.

* Different configuration method.

Version 1.1

* Replication policy evaluation.  Instead of a fixed replication strategy,
  the Globule module now checks periodically whether for a document a
  better replication strategy is more suited, and makes the switch.
  See the ReevaluateInterval directive to control this feature which is
  turned on by default and can be turned of using "ReevaluateInterval 120 0".

* Checking for the availability of replica slaves.  Whenever your site was
  replicated, but one of the replica slave sites was unavailable, browsing
  users where still being redirected to those nodes.  The master site will
  not periodically check for the slaves to be available.
  See also the ReevaluateInterval directive.

* Meta URIs are no longer used.  Which makes configuration easier, internal
  handling simpler and a cleaner protocol.

      ------------------------------------------------------------

Globule is a platform which allows a Web server to automatically replicate
its documents to other Web servers, to maintain replicas consistent using
adaptive replication policies, and to transparently redirect users to the
best replica.  It does so by negotiating resource allocation with remote
servers in a peer-to-peer fashion.  We designed Globule as a module for the
Apache Web server.  Therefore, converting Web documents should require no
more than compiling a new module into Apache and editing a configuration
file.

The originality of Globule is that is does not always use the same
replication strategy.  In our approach, each document has its own associated
strategy, which is automatically chosen such that it optimizes the global
perceived performance.

Globule contains the following sub-modules:

pSodium    http://www.globule.org/psodium/

    pSodium is a security system for replicated Web sites.  It allows replicas
    to be placed on semi-trusted servers, which are subsequently checked by
    pSodium to ensure they deliver the original content unmodified.  In
    particular, pSodium does direct probabilistic, and indirect time-shifted
    checking of replica servers.  Misbehaving slaves are automatically
    disabled, meaning that clients will no longer be directed to them.

    pSodium is implemented as an Apache module to be used in combination with
    the Globule replication system, also an Apache module.

- A-synchronous methods need a REPLY statement too, to avoid a memory leak.
- Bad identifier scanning for name mangling tries to mandle identifiers after
  the dot "." operator as well.  However these field names should not be
  mangled.
- After a SEND, WAIT or RECV statement, you need to place an additional
  semi-colon (in some cases, but to be sure use them always) because of a
  bug in de code-rewrite transformation.

- Counting the linenumbers while using literal program text
  using backquotes not correct, such that when you use backquoted
  literals and get a parse error, then the line number is correct.
- Linenumbers are now inserted in the generated code by using the #line
  preprocessor directive.  These point to the original source code.
- Renamed fornax::System.start() to fornax::System.run(Time until=infinite).
  This allows you to run until a certain time point.  The time step to the
  first event after the time period is made, but the event will only be
  scheduled, not executed.
- Events can be directly inserted when the simulation has not yet been
  started or is paused using a method in the entity class for each
  signal event queue named send_<queuename>(t,...).  The t parameter is
  the time for which the event is to be scheduled, after this the arguments
  to the event data follows.

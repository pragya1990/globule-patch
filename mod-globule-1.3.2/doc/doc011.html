<HR WIDTH="50%" SIZE=1><DL><DT><A NAME="note1" HREF="doc004.html#text1"><FONT SIZE=5>1</FONT></A><DD>It cannot hurt adding this to all occurrences,
although it is strictly only needed for Globule sections and the URL specified
by GlobuleAdminURL.
<DT><A NAME="note2" HREF="doc004.html#text2"><FONT SIZE=5>2</FONT></A><DD>In this configuration we must have a
separate global ServerName, different from the one we will be replicating in
this example. This because <TT>http://www.revolutionware.net/</TT> is being
exported from ``/'' and we had learned that the URL specified by
GlobuleAdminURL cannot overlap with an exported origin web-site. If you would
only replicate a partial site, one can use just a single hostname.
<DT><A NAME="note3" HREF="doc004.html#text3"><FONT SIZE=5>3</FONT></A><DD>With HTTP redirection
this does not do a lot of good, as new browsing clients cannot be redirected
to the replica servers when the origin is down, but this feature will become
more valuable with DNS redirection
<DT><A NAME="note4" HREF="doc004.html#text4"><FONT SIZE=5>4</FONT></A><DD>Note that in the backup server's config below the
GlobuleDefaultReplicationPolicy is set to TTL. This is the recommended
configuration: it simply means that, should a replica server fetch a document
copy from the backup, it would keep its copy for a given duration before
trying to revalidate it from the origin or its replica.
<DT><A NAME="note5" HREF="doc004.html#text5"><FONT SIZE=5>5</FONT></A><DD>Do not use specific names for any other purpose, unless you
<EM>really</EM> know what you are doing! In particular, if one server takes
part in the replication of two different sites, then it must have two
different specific names, one for each site and these should not be the
original (local) hostnames.
<DT><A NAME="note6" HREF="doc004.html#text6"><FONT SIZE=5>6</FONT></A><DD>If your registrar provides you with a web interface to assign
DNS records, the exact syntax may be different. Check your registrar's
documentation.
<DT><A NAME="note7" HREF="doc004.html#text7"><FONT SIZE=5>7</FONT></A><DD>The regular access-logs are also only
partially sorted as the timestamp recorded is the start of a web-page
transfer, but the access is written into the access-log at the end of the
transfer. This interval may already be large, but with the accumulated
Globule report-log this interval may be larger.
<DT><A NAME="note8" HREF="doc006.html#text8"><FONT SIZE=5>8</FONT></A><DD>or ServerName, but these are
not user in normal configurations.

Sends SMS whether the system is still functioning every monday at 09:30.
Upon a detected failure it will send a sms, then 180 minutes
nothing (provided the GNU version of find can be used by the monitorhosts.sh
script).  Then a reminder script to inform you where you are and the 
cycle restarts.

To reset a detected failure, first re-enable the failed server and
then remove the logs/monitorhosts.lck file.

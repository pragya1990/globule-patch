 <TT>report.log</TT> structure</H3>
<P>
Each section of a web-site being exported or imported has a <CODE>.htglobule</CODE>
directory which contains accounting information for that web-site section. In
this directory resides a.o. the <CODE>report.log</CODE>. This log contains
information which should be collected at the origin server to make decisions,
statistics and a merged log of requests (which can be converted into a
access.log).
</P>
<P>
The report.log format is completely different than apache-style log files,
because this report.log contains much more information than just requests and
has fields which are more suitable for a distributed environment than the
traditional access log formats such as common and combined log formats
</P>
<P>
To aid future development, the report.log is not a strict format, but instead
is a free-format file with limited rules on how to separate records of
requests and other relevant data and the fields of data inside a record. It
does not describe which fields in which order should be present.
</P>
<P>
The report.log is a series of unstructured records of events. Each record is
contained on a single line. Lines which start with a hash sign (<CODE>#</CODE>)
should be ignored and can be used for comments. Each line contains one or
multiple fields with data. Fields are in principle separated with one or
multiple spaced or tabs.
</P>
<P>
A field is either a single letter, used in the report.log to identify
different type of events or is a key--value pair. Key and value are seperated
with either a equal sign (<CODE>=</CODE>), a colon (<CODE>:</CODE>) or semi-colon
(<CODE>;</CODE>). The different separators serve different purposes:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><B><TT>=</TT></B><BR>
Used to separate a key from a value, where the value can only be a number.
 These numbers should bare some relation to each other. For instance,
 identifiers in principle bear no relation to each other as two persons with
 ID 3 and one with ID 5 have no logical personal bonds with each other, not
 can you induce that there should also be a person with ID 4.<BR>
However a timestamp would be suitable to use with this, as there is a
 logical enumeration of time.
<DT><DD><B><TT>;</TT></B><BR>
The semi-colon is a general key--value pair seperator, where the value field
 should not be interpreted as a number, but as some identifier. Normally,
 there is a limited amount of possible values for a certain key in the
 report.log. In other words; you should not expect to see generic text, but
 only keywords or identifiers as values in a semi-colon field.
<DT><DD><B><TT>:</TT></B><BR>
The colon field serves the same purpose as the semi-colon separator, but the
 colon can only be used as the last key--value pair and the value in
 that comes after the colon may contain spaces and/or tabs.
</DL>
</P>
<P>
The following event types can be in the report.log:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><B><TT>R</TT></B> a document has been requested by some browsing user;
<DT><DD><B><TT>U</TT></B> a document update has been detected;
<DT><DD><B><TT>I</TT></B> the document has been invalidated;
<DT><DD><B><TT>A</TT></B> to indicate that the policy of a document has
 changed;
<DT><DD><B><TT>E</TT></B> to indicate that a document has been evicted from
 the cache.
</DL>
</P>
<P>
The following fields can be expected:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>t=</TT> The timestamp when the event occured.
<DT><DD><TT>path:</TT> The path component of a URL, starting without the initial
location from which it was exported (or imported).
<DT><DD><TT>old;</TT> The previous (replication) policy that has been used.
<DT><DD><TT>new;</TT> The new (replication) policy to be used on a document.
<DT><DD><TT>lastmod=</TT> A timestamp with the last modification time of the
 document.
<DT><DD><TT>docsize=</TT> The (new) document size.
<DT><DD><TT>client;</TT> The IP number of the peer (e.g. the browsing user doing
 the request).
<DT><DD><TT>elapsed=</TT> The amount of time needed to do something (serve a
 request for instance).
<DT><DD><TT>sndsize=</TT> The number of bytes reported to be shipped.
<DT><DD><TT>browser;</TT> The User-Agent reported from the browsing user (very
 optional information).
<DT><DD><TT>referer</TT> The Referer field in the request reported by the
 browsing user (very optional information).
</DL>
</P>
<P>
Timestamps and durations are in <CODE>apr_time_t</CODE> precision, normally
microseconds. Sizes are in bytes.
</P>
<P>
Normally, but not guaranteed, the following fields are present for each event
type:
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=1>
<TR><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP><B><TT>R</TT></B></TD>
<TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>t, client, elapsed, sndsize, browser, referer, path</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP><B><TT>U</TT></B></TD>
<TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>t, lastmod, docsize, path</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP><B><TT>A</TT></B></TD>
<TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>t, old, new, path</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP><B><TT>E</TT></B></TD>
<TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>t, path</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP><B><TT>I</TT></B></TD>
<TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>t, path</TD>
</TR></TABLE>

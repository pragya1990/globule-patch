# The All* keywords allow the display of all URL's, Sites, Referrers
# User Agents, Search Strings and Usernames.  If enabled, a seperate
# HTML page will be created, and a link will be added to the bottom
# of the appropriate "Top" table.  There are a couple of conditions
# for this to occur..  First, there must be more items than will fit
# in the "Top" table (otherwise it would just be duplicating what is
# already displayed).  Second, the listing will only show those items
# that are normally visable, which means it will not show any hidden
# items.  Grouped entries will be listed first, followed by individual
# items.  The value for these keywords can be either 'yes' or 'no',
# with the default being 'no'.  Please be aware that these pages can
# be quite large in size, particularly the sites page,  and seperate
# pages are generated for each month, which can consume quite a lot
# of disk space depending on the traffic to your site.

# The Hide*, Group* and Ignore* and Include* keywords allow you to
# change the way Sites, URL's, Referrers, User Agents and Usernames
# are manipulated.  The Ignore* keywords will cause The Webalizer to
# completely ignore records as if they didn't exist (and thus not
# counted in the main site totals).  The Hide* keywords will prevent
# things from being displayed in the 'Top' tables, but will still be
# counted in the main totals.  The Group* keywords allow grouping
# similar objects as if they were one.  Grouped records are displayed
# in the 'Top' tables and can optionally be displayed in BOLD and/or
# shaded. Groups cannot be hidden, and are not counted in the main
# totals. The Group* options do not, by default, hide all the items
# that it matches.  If you want to hide the records that match (so just
# the grouping record is displayed), follow with an identical Hide*
# keyword with the same value.  (see example below)  In addition,
# Group* keywords may have an optional label which will be displayed
# instead of the keywords value.  The label should be seperated from
# the value by at least one 'white-space' character, such as a space
# or tab.
#
# The value can have either a leading or trailing '*' wildcard
# character.  If no wildcard is found, a match can occur anywhere
# in the string. Given a string "www.yourmama.com", the values "your",
# "*mama.com" and "www.your*" will all match.

# HideAllSites allows forcing individual sites to be hidden in the
# report.  This is particularly useful when used in conjunction
# with the "GroupDomain" feature, but could be useful in other
# situations as well, such as when you only want to display grouped
# sites (with the GroupSite keywords...).  The value for this
# keyword can be either 'yes' or 'no', with 'no' the default,
# allowing individual sites to be displayed.

#HideAllSites	no

# The GroupDomains keyword allows you to group individual hostnames
# into their respective domains.  The value specifies the level of
# grouping to perform, and can be thought of as 'the number of dots'
# that will be displayed.  For example, if a visiting host is named
# cust1.tnt.mia.uu.net, a domain grouping of 1 will result in just
# "uu.net" being displayed, while a 2 will result in "mia.uu.net".
# The default value of zero disable this feature.  Domains will only
# be grouped if they do not match any existing "GroupSite" records,
# which allows overriding this feature with your own if desired.

#GroupDomains	0

# The GroupShading allows grouped rows to be shaded in the report.
# Useful if you have lots of groups and individual records that
# intermingle in the report, and you want to diferentiate the group
# records a little more.  Value can be 'yes' or 'no', with 'yes'
# being the default.

#GroupShading	yes

# GroupHighlight allows the group record to be displayed in BOLD.
# Can be either 'yes' or 'no' with the default 'yes'.

#GroupHighlight	yes

# The Ignore* keywords allow you to completely ignore log records based
# on hostname, URL, user agent, referrer or username.  I hessitated in
# adding these, since the Webalizer was designed to generate _accurate_
# statistics about a web servers performance.  By choosing to ignore
# records, the accuracy of reports become skewed, negating why I wrote
# this program in the first place.  However, due to popular demand, here
# they are.  Use the same as the Hide* keywords, where the value can have
# a leading or trailing wildcard '*'.  Use at your own risk ;)

#IgnoreSite	bad.site.net
#IgnoreURL	/test*
#IgnoreReferrer	file:/*
#IgnoreAgent	RealPlayer
#IgnoreUser     root

# The Include* keywords allow you to force the inclusion of log records
# based on hostname, URL, user agent, referrer or username.  They take
# precidence over the Ignore* keywords.  Note: Using Ignore/Include
# combinations to selectivly process parts of a web site is _extremely
# inefficent_!!! Avoid doing so if possible (ie: grep the records to a
# seperate file if you really want that kind of report).

# Example: Only show stats on Joe User's pages...
#IgnoreURL	*
#IncludeURL	~joeuser*

# Or based on an authenticated username
#IgnoreUser     *
#IncludeUser    someuser

# The MangleAgents allows you to specify how much, if any, The Webalizer
# should mangle user agent names.  This allows several levels of detail
# to be produced when reporting user agent statistics.  There are six
# levels that can be specified, which define different levels of detail
# supression.  Level 5 shows only the browser name (MSIE or Mozilla)
# and the major version number.  Level 4 adds the minor version number
# (single decimal place).  Level 3 displays the minor version to two
# decimal places.  Level 2 will add any sub-level designation (such
# as Mozilla/3.01Gold or MSIE 3.0b).  Level 1 will attempt to also add
# the system type if it is specified.  The default Level 0 displays the
# full user agent field without modification and produces the greatest
# amount of detail.  User agent names that can't be mangled will be
# left unmodified.

#MangleAgents    0

# The SearchEngine keywords allow specification of search engines and
# their query strings on the URL.  These are used to locate and report
# what search strings are used to find your site.  The first word is
# a substring to match in the referrer field that identifies the search
# engine, and the second is the URL variable used by that search engine
# to define it's search terms.

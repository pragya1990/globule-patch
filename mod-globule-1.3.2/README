      ------------------------------------------------------------

Globule is a platform which allows a Web server to automatically replicate
its documents to other Web servers, to maintain replicas consistent using
adaptive replication policies, and to transparently redirect users to the
best replica. It does so by negotiating resource allocation with remote
servers in a peer-to-peer fashion. We designed Globule as a module for the
Apache Web server. Therefore, converting Web documents should require no
more than compiling a new module into Apache and editing a configuration
file.

The originality of Globule is that is does not always use the same
replication strategy. In our approach, each document has its own associated
strategy, which is automatically chosen such that it optimizes the global
perceived performance. 

The installation instructions and further documentation for mod-globule

* Weighted and balanced based redirection policies.

* Modularized configuration of debug-filters (non-user accessible yet).
  in favor of dropped GlobuleMonitor support.

* Throw exception usage, declaration, and catching.

* ``globuleutil'' utility program implementation and included webalizer
  support, see documentation.

* Removal of old-style debug messages, debug messages at proper level.

* More information logged in report.log on client.

mod_globule 1.3.0
-----------------
                                                                               
* Renamed libglobule.so to mod_globule.so.

* Rewritten NetAirt and fully integrated into the core of Globule.
  Dropped the GlobuelBGPSlotSize as the BGP table is now also stored
  in the normal shared memory.

* Dropped directives GlobuleMaxSites and GlobuleMaxReplicas.
* Dropped directives GlobuleSite, GlobuleSiteRR, and GlobuleSiteAS.

* Single piece of shared memory now used, all shared memory allocation uses
  APR RMM.

* Added pSodium to source tree.  Alpha release for this module, as it is
  untested.  The pSodium module compiles into a seperate mod_psodium.so
  Apache module.  By default pSodium is not compiled nor installed, but
  can be enabled by providing the flag --enable-psodium to the ./configure
  script.  Required OpenSSl (--with-openssl=path).

* Revamping of the persistency object, in order to:
  - prevent memory leaks at the GlobuleConf::globalpool is no longer needed.

mod_globule 1.2.3
-----------------

* Fix for bug where invalidates on /subdirectory/index.html where lost
  when the master had been restarted between first retrieval and file update.

* Though --with-apache is the preferred way of indicating where your Apache
  installation resides, you can also use --with-apxs to specify the location
  of the Apache apxs program.

* In the error_log all messages from Globule are no longer all marked as
  errors.  This does not mean that in all cases the messages are properly
  marked, sometimes messages are marked warnings, while they are just
  very important informational messages.
  Added some informational messages on the configuration of Globule during
  startup sequence.

* Fix to GlobuleReplicate off to prevent redirection for unreplicated files.

* Patch to allow notification to slaves upon deletion of documents.

* Date on GLOBULETRACE cookie now according to netscape standard i.s.o. RFC822.

* Exporting a site without replicas will no longer cause the server to fail
  to start.

mod_globule 1.2.2
-----------------

* GlobuleDebugProfile directive now lets you specify the verbosity of the
  debugging and informational output of Globule, instead of the unsupported
  GlobuleMonitor lines.

* DNS redirection fixed on issue #135, which occurs when Globule is used as
  the sole resource for resolving a hostname for which it is itself the
  authorative resolved.  Which means that during startup phase, Globule needs
  to resolve it's own hostname.
  Additionally stand-alone redirection was seriously broken, as no redirection
  was ever done.

* When a master was unavailable, a replica server did not respond correctly to
  the browsing client (it returned an empty page) and cached this erroneous
  result.
  As a related issues, non-existend documents where not purged.

* Corrections to generation of messages to the report.log.

* Purging of document from cache caused segmentation faults.

* Apache 2.0.50 is now then minimal required, as temporary directories need
  to be aquired in a platform independent manner.
	
mod_globule 1.2.1
-----------------

* Fix for crash during startup when compiled without -ggdb caused by incorrect
  debugging macros.

* Buffer reuse problem fixes (issue #112), which surfaces afawk on Windows
  platform due to their slow performance.  The result is that parts out
  of pages seemed to be missing.

* Fix for problem when retrieving a directory index (#122).

* Bug fix which fixes a possible problem with invalidates.

* Fixes for disconnected operation (issues #114, #122, a.o.).

* Various minor changes.

mod_globule 1.2.0
-----------------

* Disconnected operation, to allow a master to become available and Backup
  servers will handle requests.  Stand alone redirector included.

* Run-time enabling of debug messages.

* Fixed bug #77: When a request to an exporting server is not succesful
  (i.e. HTTP status < 200 || >= 300 && !304), e.g. 404 the server will now 
  delete the Document object. Previously, it would keep the object, resulting
  in confusing behavior where invalidates would be sent to slaves
  for non-existent documents.
  
* Implemented URI comparison rules of HTTP/1.1, enabling Globule to recognize
  equivalent URIs: e.g. 
  	http://www.cs.vu.nl/export == HttP://www.CS.VU.nl/exp%6Frt/

* Extended test suite with tests for variations of import paths.
  Seperate new style test suite.

* Fixed bug #96: Problem when using Apache User directive: Ownership of some
  files in the Globule cachedir was not transferred to the user that will
  run the Apache child processes, causing permission denied problems at
  restart.

* Windows support.

* DNS redirection.

* Major overhaul of the directives.  More flexible method to replicate based
  on Apache Location/Directory/Files environments.

* Virtual Hosts support.

mod_globule 1.1.4: Bug fix release for Solaris
---------------------------------------

* To avoid concurrency problems with gethostbyname.
  and other Portability issues for Solaris.

mod_globule 1.1.3rc1: Bug fix release
---------------------------------------

* Attempt to fix bug #99: All pools used in our code are now of class AprPool.
  AprPool has been rewritten to (hopefully) prevent process crashes caused
  by problems with the cleanup functions of apr_pool_t pools. In addition, 
  The http/HttpRequest class's connect() call will now timeout if setting up
  the connection takes too long. This caused an importing server to stall
  request handling for a certain partition of the documents available if
  something went wrong at the exporting server during import.

* Extra concurrency control added.

* Internal improvements.


mod_globule 1.1.2: Bug fix release
---------------------------------------

* Re-fixed where invalidates which were not accepted by the security module.
* Fix for problems with the adaptation module.
* The heartbeat is now done in the child processes.
* Shortened the time to recognize a server being down when a timeout needs
  to occur.


mod_globule 1.1.1: Bug fix release
---------------------------------------

* Patch for Bug #86, which prevents multiple ImportFrom directives
  in the configuration.
* Fix for problem where document adaptation was based only on the
  cost function of the first document.
* Fix for invalidates which were not accepted by the security module
  because port 80 was included in the URL.


mod_globule 1.1.0: First adaptive replication release
-----------------------------------------------------

* Periodic automatic run-time replication policy adaptation by means of
  simulating the request pattern of the past period.

* Detection of the availability of slave replicas to avoid direction
  to a mis-configured server or a slave server which is down.

* Support for compilation and packaging on FreeBSD and Debian.

* Framework for monitoring the server (visible request tracking bug 29).

* Fixes for the invalidation policy (bugs 78, 79): Due to bug #79 an 
  exporting Globule would delete its Document object after an error occured 
  when invalidating a replica. This causes an exporting server to forget about 
  *all* replicas for that document, resulting in inconsistencies.

* Removed the MetaURIs, invalidations and reporting are now send through
  SIGNAL and REPORT HTTP requests.
  server to do request processing for an excluded document.

* Fixed bug #69: A replica server will now set a PURE_PROXY policy for any
  documents that the master server returns that are not actively managed by
  the master Globule module. This includes the generated document indices.
  
* A replica server will not set a last-modified header if the master
  did not return one ;o)

* Fixed bug #65: Docs now readable on-line and off-line with Internet 
  Explorer.

* Fixed bug #64 and #66: Offline updates to documents are now detected,
  unless they are made concurrently with the exporting server shutting
  down.

* Fixed bug #41: Server now warns about multiple ImportFrom's in a
  GlobuleImport and the occurence of multiple GlobuleExport's (only one
  allowed).

* Fixed bug #76: AS-based redirection on Solaris 8 did not work due to
  the client socket address not being set properly.

* Various other bug fixes.



mod_globule 1.0.1: Bug fix release
----------------------------------

* Fixed problem with UserDir functionality: Accessing /~user/ on an
  exporting site would crash the server.

* Added warning message for people trying to replicate a non-Globule site.


mod_globule 1.0.0: First public release
---------------------------------------

* Changed configure.in to get a correct version number on libglobule.so.

* Reduced error_log output in level 3: less info on resource management.

* Updated documentation.



mod_globule 0.9: Fifth internal release
---------------------------------------

* First version of proper documentation. 

* Fixed bug 47: Warnings during compilation of mod_netairt.c

* Fixed bug 48: Replication policy now always set to default, which is
  Invalidate.

* Fixed bug 49: Outdated TODO file removed.

* Partially fixed bug 51:  Headers from master now semi-properly copied over
  the client response. More needs to be done.

* Fixed bug 52: A bug in how we used the call-function-when-pool-deleted
  caused child processes forked to run e.g. a cgi-bin script to crash.



mod_globule 0.8: Fourth internal release
----------------------------------------

* Fixed bug 26+28: The directives have been renamed and there is now
  a single password for each (master,slave) pair.

* Fixed bug 27: The master will now refuse to deliver to a slave requesting 
  a URL that matches the master's DoNotReplicate directives.

* Fixed bug 32: error_log contains error message on auth failure. Apache
  returns std. server error HTML for 401.

* Fixed bug 40: We now make sure the permissions on global mutexes are
  set correctly, such that locks actually work when a server is started
  as root and then spawns non-root children.

* The GlobuleLockCount directive can now be used without also setting
  the GlobuleCacheDir directive (copy 'n paste bug).

* Fixed a bug showing up in servers not running port 80. When a slave
  requests / from the master, mod_dir.c will try to turn this into
  /index.html or something. In the process, it appears to forget to
  propagate the port number of the original request, resulting in
  an authentication failure for the slave.


mod_globule 0.7: Third internal release
----------------------------------------
* Fixed bug 23: Module now compiles on Solaris 5.8.

* Fixed bug 24: Documentation now says the 'configure' parameter is 
  --with-apache, not --with-apache-dir

* Fixed bug 25: Compile flag -Wmissing-declarations omitted for C++ files.

* Fixed bug 31: Globule now works properly with a slave and master running
  on port 80. Globule did not properly handle port-less URIs.


mod_globule 0.6: Second internal release
----------------------------------------
* Number of OS mutexes used by Globule now configurable via GlobuleLockCount
  directive.

* We no longer use apr_temp_get_dir() to allow Apache versions < 2.0.48.

* We now allocate only 5 MB of shared memory (was 64 MB) by default.

* Simpler password scheme where there is a password pair for each slave:
  A master password by which the master authenticates itself to the slave
  and a slave password by which the slave authenticates itself to the master.

* No longer crashes when Globule directives are used inside VirtualHost
  directives (note: Globule cannot at the moment be used with VirtualHosts).

* The ownership of Globule's cache directories is changed to the user that
  will run Apache (i.e., the user specified in the directive User).

* Method for installing 2 Apache sites was flawed, removed from documentation.

* HTTP Errors generated at the master Globule are now passed on to the slave's 
  client.

* Removed limitations on the URI prefixes that can be used in GlobuleMaster and
  GlobuleSlave directives. E.g. / is now allowed for both masters and slaves.
  See documentation for details.

* New Globule directive "DoNotReplicate" that allows certain paths to be
  excluded from replication. Particularly useful for a master exporting
  / to slaves (e.g. to exclude /cgi-bin)

* Flood tests, that is, tests that do many concurrent requests on Globule
  are now part of the test suite.

* More code sharing in test suite.

* All documents that are found on disk after a server reboot are now
  reactivated, such that they can register for file updates if their policy
  requires it (e.g. invalidation).

* Slave now returns HTTP 301 moved when a trailing slash is missing on
  an URI pointing to a directory.

* Solved bug that sometimes caused Globule to crash after processing a request
  (shared memory database of mod_netairt was not always allocated).



mod_globule 0.5: First internal release
---------------------------------------
* NetAirt integrated
* Inter-server authentication
* Added test suite

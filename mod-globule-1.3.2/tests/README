Globule Tests
=============

[Getting it to work:]
---------------------
You have to update the ssl.conf and the httpd.conf in globule/apache/conf
directory to reflect the directory structure that you are using.
(e.g. replace /home/berry with /home/wdittmer) These two configuration
files are used to generate the httpd.conf

Also if you run the master test set, make symbolic links to master/conf
and master/htdocs in this dir. If you run the slave test set, do the same.


[Test that are (should be) done:]
---------------------

* Setup: one master, no slaves
  o Client requests a normal doc from Master                        (200)
  o Client requests a G-doc from Master                             (200)
  o Client requests G-directory without '/'                         (301)
    returns request url with '/'
  o Master handles Slave with wrong password correctly              (401)

* Setup: one master, one slave, RR redirect, Invalidate
  o Client requests a normal doc from Master                        (200)
  o Client requests a G-doc from Master, check for redirect         (200|302)
    (Requires registered slave)
  o Client requests G-directory without '/' from Master             (301) 
  o Master handles Slave registration correctly                     (200)
  o Master handles Slave with wrong password correctly              (401)
  o Master handles update G-docs correctly (i.e. sends Invalidate)  (200)
    (Requires registered slave, check Slave handles Invalidate)
  o Client requests a normal doc from Slave                         (200)
  o Client requests a G-doc from Slave                              (200)
  o Client requests a G-directory from Slave without '/'            (301)
    returns request url with '/'
  o Client requests a G-directory from Slave with '/'               (301)
    returns request url with '/index.html'

* Setup: no master, one slave
  o Client requests normal doc from Slave                           (200)
  o Client requests G-doc from Slave                                (500)

INTRO
-----
There are four test groups:

directives : Test processing of valid and invalid configuration files
master     : Test master behaviour of Globule, standalone.
slave      : Test slave behaviour of Globule, standalone.
combined   : Test master and slave behaviour using multiple servers.
flood      : Test concurrent access (master and slave individually).
floodcomb  : Test concurrent access to slave with real master.

Each test group consists of one or more test supersets. E.g. for the
master there are the "noslave" and "oneslave" test supersets. A test
superset consists of a number of testsets. Each testset (i.e., a "*.t"
file) consists of a number of tests that can pass of fail
individually. These tests are generally not individually visible in
the output, unless a test fails. If there are no failures, the
testset will print "ok" indicating all tests succeeded.

(The terminology used may be non-intuitive. I prefer to call each
"*.t" file a test and each superset (e.g. noslave) a testset, as
each "*.t" file currently tests one particular aspect of Globule. 
However, the Perl test framework used has "test" as the smallest
unit, so I stick with that.)

INSTALLING
----------
To run these tests you need to have the Apache testing framework,
available from
    http://httpd.apache.org/test/

Good luck getting that installed :-( For the flood tests you also
need to install the flood program that is part of the framework.


RUNNING
-------
All test groups can be run at once using
	make test
	
Individual test groups can be run by 
	make <test group>

You can also run make in each of the subdirectories.


OUTPUT
------
Each individual testset will print an 

<filename>....ok
or
<filename>....FAILED test X.

message. If you add -verbose to the TESTOPTS in shared.mk you will
get the output of the individual tests in each file/testset. (For
the directives test group it will not show any individual tests.)


FLOODCOMB 
--------- 
The floodcomb tests currently load only the slave directly. There are no
test clients that talk to the master directly. The reason is that the test
client software (i.e. the flood program) cannot currently handle HTTP
redirects and will fail. The master's functionality minus redirects is tested
by the non-combined flood test on the master.

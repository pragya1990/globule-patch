<PRE>
<b>GlobuleAdminURL</b> <i>url</i> [ <i>password</i> ]
</PRE>
<P>
Set the internal reference and configuration location. Globule requires a
path by which the internals of Globule can be reached. This is used by
Globule to contact itself and to provide monitoring information. Any location
which addresses an available space of your web-server is valid. The URL must
end with a slash and must by a fully qualified path, including protocol
<CODE>http://</CODE> and hostname.
</P>

<PRE>
<b>GlobuleBrokerConfigurationSerial</b> <i>text</i>
</PRE>
<P>
For use with the Globule Broker System (GBS) at
<TT>http://www.globeworld.net/</TT>. The
<B>GlobuleBrokerConfigurationSerial</B> directive is automatically generated
by the GBS system to indicate the last time this configuration file has been
generated. It should not be changed or removed from the configuration if
present. There is no use for specifying this directive by hand. Globule
itself only stores the date value specified, but does not interpret it. The
value is returned by the page as specified by GlobuleAdminURL with appended
path <TT>/gbs</TT>.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="htoc46">5.1.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="GlobuleFancyServerName">GlobuleFancyServerName</A></H4>
<PRE>
<b>GlobuleFancyServerName</b> "<i>A fancy name for this machine</i>"
</PRE>
<P>
Gives the server some verbose human interpretable name. This is not used by
Globule itself, but in normal settings reported back through special headers
back to the browser and may be used by a Javascript program or special
plug-ins.
This is usefull to indicate by whom the request was actually served,
especially when using DNS redirection. Not only for diagnostical reasons, but
also some publicity can be used to indicate on the web-page ``this web-site was
 by ...''.
</P>
<P>
For this reason there are three possible type of values this directive
recommended to give this directive:
<UL><LI>
either it can be a fully specified URL pointing to some image which has
a logo or sorts of the site.
<LI>it can be a single word identifying the server
<LI>it can be an entire text line, however without HTML formatting.
</UL>
The latter is however not always nicely reported back to the user for all type
of display scripts.
</P>
<P>
If not specified, defaults to the ServerName in effect. This directive can be
specified at a global level and later overridden on a per globule imported or
exported section.

<PRE>
<b>GlobuleDebugProfile</b> [ <b>defaults</b> | <b>normal</b> | <b>extended</b> | <b>verbose</b> ]
</PRE>
<P>
Specifies how verbose the error reporting should be by Globule. The
``defaults'' setting is now equivalent to the setting ``normal'', this default
setting does not output much information about its workings and logs only
serious error messages. You can change this by selecting one of the standard
profiles.
</P>
<P>
Note that even though the setting may be set to ``verbose'', the messages with
log-level ``informational'', etcetera may still be suppressed by a LogLevel
directive as used by Apache. For instance, if you set your ErrorLevel to
error, you will not see most messages which would have been outputted by the
extended profile. Also remember that with Apache, you should specify the
ErrorLevel <EM>before</EM> the ErrorLog directive.
</P>

<PRE>
<b>GlobuleMemSize</b> <i>size</i>
</PRE>
<P>
Instructs Globule to use a shared memory segment of the instructed size
instead of the default. The size is in bytes, but may be followed with a
denomination as specified in&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:units">5.7</A>, such as in:
</P>
<PRE>
GlobuleMemSize "8 mb"
</PRE>
<P>
Which specifies 8 megabyte, or 8388608 bytes, which is also the default.
</P>
<P>
Many Linux/Unix operating systems do not allow large quantities of shared
memory to be allocated. Instructions on how to check your current limits, and
increase them if necessary, are available in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc007.html#sec:trouble:shmem">6.2.1</A>.

<P>
The <TT>GlobuleReplicate</TT> directive is used in an origin server to define
which part of the site must be copied to replica, backup or redirector
servers. It must be contained within a standard Apache <TT>&lt;Location&gt;</TT>,
<TT>&lt;Directory&gt;</TT> or <TT>&lt;Files&gt;</TT> environment. It specifies that all the
contents which match that environment should (or should not) be replicated to
replica servers, overriding an earlier-defined parent location
specification. This way you can turn off replication for a sub-location, and
turn it on again for a sub-sub-location. Also replication can be turned off
for files matching a given pattern, using the Apache <TT>&lt;Files&gt;</TT> and
<TT>&lt;FilesMatch&gt;</TT> environment.

In a hierarchy of <TT>&lt;Location&gt;</TT> with <TT>GlobuleReplicate</TT> set on and off,
only the parent definition should contain <A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaIs">GlobuleReplicaIs</A>,
<A HREF="#GlobuleBackupIs">GlobuleBackupIs</A> and/or <A HREF="#GlobuleRedirectorIs">GlobuleRedirectorIs</A>
directives. They are defined for the whole section of locations. You cannot
overload them in sub-locations.
</P>
<P>
Note that a location definition using <TT>&lt;Location /export&gt;</TT> may mean
something different from <TT>&lt;Location /export/&gt;</TT>. The latter is a directory
specification, which is probably what you want.
</P>

<PRE>
<b>GlobuleReplicaIs</b> http://replica.full.domain/  p4ssw0rd1
<b>GlobuleReplicaIs</b> http://replica.full.domain:8333/replicapath/ p4ssw0rd2
</PRE>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleReplicaIs</TT> is used at origin servers to specify which servers
should act as a replica for the site. For each specified replica server, it
also defines a password which is used for mutual authentication between the
origin and the replica. Note that it is in general not a good idea to use the
same password for several origin-replica pairs.
</P>
<P>
Replica servers listed on the origin server must add a corresponding
<A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaFor">GlobuleReplicaFor</A> directive. The origin's
<TT>GlobuleReplicaIs</TT> directive and the corresponding replica's
<TT>GlobuleReplicaFor</TT> directive must mention the same password, otherwise
mutual authentication will fail.
</P>
<P>
The URL mentioned in <TT>GlobuleReplicaIs</TT> is a concatenation of the replica
server's fully qualified hostname, port number (if different from 80) and its
import path as defined in the replica's <A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaFor">GlobuleReplicaFor</A>
definition. Fully qualified hostnames are mandatory. The path must end in a
slash, as a whole directory is normally exported.
</P>

</PRE>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleBackupIs</TT> is similar to the <A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaIs">GlobuleReplicaIs</A>
directive, except that is is used at an origin server to define backups of the
site (rather than to define its replicas). It also takes the same arguments.
</P>
<P>
Backup servers listed on the origin server must add a corresponding
<A HREF="#GlobuleBackupFor">GlobuleBackupFor</A> directive. The origin's <TT>GlobuleBackupIs</TT>
directive and the corresponding backup's <TT>GlobuleBackupFor</TT> directive must
mention the same password, otherwise mutual authentication will fail.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all replicas of the site must add a
<A HREF="#GlobuleBackupForIs">GlobuleBackupForIs</A> directive in their configuration. When they
need a fresh copy of a document, if the origin server is unreachable, then
they will retrieve it from one of the backups specified that way.
</P>

</PRE>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleRedirectorIs</TT> is used at an origin server to specify one or more
stand-alone redirectors for the site. Using one or more redirector(s) external
to the origin server is useful to keep the site running even though the origin
may be down.
</P>
<P>
If no redirector is specified for a given origin, then the origin server will
automatically act as its own redirector.
</P>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleRedirectorIs</TT> takes the same arguments as a
<A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaIs">GlobuleReplicaIs</A> directive.
</P>
<P>
Redirector servers listed at an origin server must add a corresponding
<A HREF="#GlobuleRedirectorFor">GlobuleRedirectorFor</A> directive. The origin's
<TT>GlobuleRedirectorIs</TT> directive and the corresponding backup's
<TT>GlobuleRedirectorFor</TT> directive must mention the same password, otherwise
mutual authentication will fail.

<P>
The <TT>GlobuleReplicaFor</TT> directive is used to configure a replica
server. This directive must be used within a <TT>&lt;Location&gt;</TT> or
<TT>VirtualServer</TT> container which indicates what is the location of the
replica. <TT>GlobuleReplicaFor</TT> must match a corresponding
<A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaIs">GlobuleReplicaIs</A> directive configured at the origin server.
</P>
<P>
The <TT>GlobuleReplicaFor</TT> directive takes as parameters the URL of the
origin site, and a password. The URL must contain a fully qualified host name,
and refer to the whole path specified at the origin server (e.g., if the
origin server exports <TT>http://www.mysite.com/myorigin/</TT> then you cannot
import only <TT>http://www.mysite.com/myorigin/subdir/</TT> at the replica. The
specified password must be the same as in the origin server's configuration,
otherwise authentication will not work.
</P>
<P>
Note that, if the site has one or more backup(s), then they must be mentioned
in each replica server's configuration using the
<A HREF="#GlobuleBackupForIs">GlobuleBackupForIs</A> directive.

The <TT>GlobuleBackupFor</TT> directive is used to configure a backup
server. This directive must be used within a <TT>&lt;Location&gt;</TT> or
<TT>VirtualServer</TT> container which indicates what is the location of the
backup. <TT>GlobuleReplicaFor</TT> must match a corresponding
<A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaIs">GlobuleReplicaIs</A> directive configured at the origin server.
</P>
<P>
The URL must contain a fully qualified host name, and refer to the whole path
specified at the origin server (e.g., if the origin server exports
<TT>http://www.mysite.com/myorigin/</TT> then you cannot import only
<TT>http://www.mysite.com/myorigin/subdir/</TT> at the backup. The specified

</PRE>
<P>
The <TT>GlobuleBackupForIs</TT> directive is used at the replica servers to
specify the list of backup servers they can access in case the origin is
down. The first argument defines the fully qualified URL of the origin
server. This should be the same as indicated in the
<A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaFor">GlobuleReplicaFor</A> directive. The second argument defines the
fully qualified URL of the backup.

</PRE>
<P>
The <TT>GlobuleRedirectorForIs</TT> directive is used at the origin servers to
specify one or more external redirector(s). Each <TT>GlobuleRedirectorForIs</TT>
directive must match a corresponding <A HREF="#GlobuleRedirectorIs">GlobuleRedirectorIs</A>
directive at the redirector server.
</P>
<P>
If no external redirector is defined for a given site, then the origin server
will perform the redirection itself.
</P>
<P>
External redirectors are useful because they allow clients to be redirected to
replicas even though the master server is down. To build a reasonably
fault-tolerant site, at least two external redirectors are necessary.
</P>
<P>
This directive takes two parameters. The <TT>url</TT> parameter defines for which
site the redirector will be defined. The URL must exactly match an exported
path as indicated by a <A HREF="#GlobuleReplicate">GlobuleReplicate</A> directive at the origin
server. The second parameter is a password used for mutual authentication
between the origin and the redirector servers. The same password must be
present in both configurations.

<PRE>
<b>GlobuleDefaultReplicationPolicy</b> {<b>Ttl</b>|<b>Alex</b>|<b>Invalidate</b>|<b>PureProxy}</b>
</PRE>
<P>
The <TT>GlobuleDefaultReplicationPolicy</TT> directive defines the replication
policy that should be associated to new documents. After a while, Globule will
use the recorded access logs to this document to decide on which policy is
best for this document.
</P>
<P>
Globule contains five different policies:
</P>
<P>
<UL><LI>
<TT>Ttl</TT> replicates the document at the replica server for a
 finite time (currently fixed at 10 seconds). After this delay, the
 document is removed from the replica. When requested for this
 document later on, it will fetch it again from the master or one of
 its backups.
<LI><TT>Alex</TT> is similar to the Ttl policy, but computes the time
 at which a documents remains valid based on the last update of that
 document. The validity period of a document is defined as a fraction
 of its age (defined as the delay between the time it was last
 updated and the time it was fetched by the replica server). 
<LI><TT>Invalidate</TT> replicates the document at the replica servers
 for indefinite time. when a copy of the document is made at a
 replica server, the origin server remembers where copies of this
 document are located. As soon as the document is updated, the origin
 server will send invalidations to the replicas to ask them to
 destroy their stale copy.
<LI><TT>PureProxy</TT> does not replicate documents. Each time a
 replica will receive a request for the document, it will fetch it
 from the master and deliver it to the client without storing it in
 its repository. 
</UL>
</P>
<P>
The only sensible replication strategy to be used for disconnected origin
server operation is currently <TT>Invalidate</TT>.
</P>
<P>
The default is <TT>Invalidate</TT>.
</P>

<PRE>
GlobuleMaxDiskSpace 64mb
</PRE>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleMaxDiskSpace</TT> is used at replica servers to define how much disk
space may be used for storing the replicated site. If the size of the site is
greater than the configured allowed space, then rarely-accessed documents will
be removed from the replica. Note that Globule may exceed this limit
temporarily while servicing a request.
</P>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleMaxDiskSpace</TT> takes one parameter, which is the size allocated for
this replica in bytes. You may append a unit size such as ``kb'', ``mb'',
``gb'' or even ``gigabytes''. Note that the default is in bytes, so if you
specify just ``100'' it will probably pose some problems as 100 bytes it
probably too little for even a single document.
</P>
<P>
Default value is 50&nbsp;MB.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="htoc61">5.2.11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="GlobuleMaxMetaDocsInMemory">GlobuleMaxMetaDocsInMemory</A></H4>
<PRE>
GlobuleMaxMetaDocsInMemory 1000
</PRE>
<P>
Globule never stores documents in main memory. However, for performance
reasons, it often stores information about documents (i.e., meta-documents) in
memory.
</P>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleMaxMetaDocsInMemory</TT> is used at the origin, replica and backup
servers to define how many meta-documents may reside in main memory. Note that
Globule may temporarily exceed this limit while servicing a request.
</P>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleMaxMetaDocsInMemory</TT> takes one parameter, which is (as you
guessed) the maximum number of meta-documents.
</P>
<P>
If you increase this limit, then you must probably also increase
<A HREF="#GlobuleMemSize">GlobuleMemSize</A>, otherwise your server may crash.
</P>
<P>
The default value is 500.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="htoc62">5.2.12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="GlobuleLockCount">GlobuleLockCount</A></H4>
<PRE>
GlobuleLockCount 4
</PRE>
<P>
Globule uses locks to synchronize access to shared memory. The
number of locks can be set at a global level or can be overridden in
an exported or imported section. A high number of locks will take
more resources on your machine, but it will allow better
multitasking at the Globule server.
</P>
<P>
Some Linux/Unix systems will restrict the number of locks that you can
allocate. Instructions on how to check your current limits, and increase them
if necessary, are available in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="doc007.html#sec:trouble:locks">6.2.2</A>.
</P>
<P>
The default value is 4 locks per exported or imported web-site.

 &lt;/Location&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Globule needs to store information about documents on disk. Each origin,
replica or backup configured at a given Globule server will need its own
repository for meta-documents.
</P>
<P>
If no <TT>GlobuleDirectory</TT> directive is defined, then meta-documents are
stored <EM>within the directory which contains documents</EM>, in a
sub-directory called <TT>.htglobule</TT>. The <TT>GlobuleDirectory</TT> directive
allows to set this directory to a different path.
</P>
<P>
<TT>GlobuleDirectory</TT> take as parameter the absolute path of the directory
where meta-documents must be stored instead.
If the specified directory does not exist, Globule will create it
automatically. When Globule is started as root, it will transfer the ownership
of the directories in the <TT>GlobuleDirectory</TT> to the user that will run the
worker servers (i.e., the user specified via the standard Apache User
directive.)
The use of this directive is however discouraged and may be depricated in
future.

</PRE>
<P>
At the origin server the first syntax form is used to establish a connection
to the actual database. The latter forms are used at the replica sites to
tunnel queries to the origin server. In effect, both forms provide a method
for executing queries on the database using a HTTP interface, to be used by
Globule only (``mounting the database on a HTTP address'').
</P>
<P>
The GlobuleDatabase directive should be enclosed inside a <CODE>&lt;Location&gt;</CODE>
environment, where origin and replica servers should use the same path in the
Location, otherwise PHP scripts cannot transparently access the database.
Normally the <I>hostname</I> is set to <CODE>localhost</CODE> to use the local
database accessible through a Unix domain socket. The <CODE>#password</CODE> part
is optional, if left out an empty password is used.
</P>
<P>
The shared password <I>secret</I> should be match between origin and all
replica servers, to shield the usage of the database interface by
non-authorized users.<BR>
Only access to the defined database is given, not other databases on the
database server. If multiple databases are to be accessed, each one should
use a GlobuleDatabase definition.

The <TT>GlobuleRedirectionMode</TT> directive defines which redirection
mechanism should be used by a server.
<UL><LI>
OFF disables redirection; 
<LI>HTTP activates HTTP-based redirection (302 Moved); 
<LI>DNS activates internal DNS server (requires access to port 53,
 so you probably must have administrator privileges);
<LI>BOTH activates both HTTP and DNS redirection modes.

</P>
<P>
To use DNS redirection, you must use our patched version of Apache, so that it

 other, without trying to optimize the client-to-replica distance.
<LI>bf WRR enables weighted round-robin. Operates like RR, except
 that replica's are assigned weights, where replica's with a higher weight
 are selected more often to be the first on the list to be returned.
<LI><B>AS</B> enables AS-based redirection. It redirects each client
 to a replica so that the number of
 <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29">Autonomous
 Systems</A> traversed on the client-to-replica path is minimized. It
 needs to read network routing information from a file (see the

 <A HREF="#GlobuleBGPReloadAfter">GlobuleBGPReloadAfter</A> directives).
<LI><B>BAS</B> enables a balanced AS-based redirection. Operates like AS,
 except that replica's are assigned weights and if a replica is chosen 
 more often that others in respect to its assigned weight, it will be
 skipped until it load is more in line with the other replica's.
<LI><B>WRAND</B> enables weighted random redirection. Replica's are chosen
 randomly, where replica's with a higher weight are more likely to be chosen.
<LI><B>static</B> always returns the first host in the list (this is
 sometimes useful when doing stand-alone redirection, i.e., when
 replication is disabled).

To use the AS-based redirection policies, you must first download a view of the
current routing information from the routeviews.org Web site. At
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/"><TT>ftp://ftp.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/</TT></A> there is a
directory for the current year and month, containing a file called
<TT>oix-full-snapshot-latest.dat.bz2</TT>. You need to download the most recent
file, and uncompress it using the
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">bzip2</A> utility. You then make the
file available to Globule via this <TT>GlobuleBGPDataFile</TT> directive.
</P>
<P>
Based on this file, Globule creates a map of the Internet, and then uses it to
calculate the distance between clients and replicas. In general, only the most
recent BGP data file needs to be downloaded from the RouteViews site. If the
BGP data file is unavailable or corrupted, Globule will default to static
redirection.

This directive controls how often periodic tasks should take place. The most

take a long time before an unavailable replica is noticed and clients are no
longer redirected to it.

Every few heart beat events, Globule will reevaluate its choices of
replication policies for each document. If the current policy for a document
is no longer the best one, its replication policy will be switched to the new
best one. Evaluating the policy is done on a per-document basis, but all
documents for an exported path are evaluated in one go. The
<TT>GlobulePolicyAdaptationInterval</TT> directive specifies the delay (in
seconds) between policy re-evaluations.
</P>

Please note that the <TT>GlobulePolicyAdaptationInterval</TT> must be a multiple
of <A HREF="#GlobuleHeartBeatInterval">GlobuleHeartBeatInterval</A>. If it is not, then it will be

Replication policies should not be re-evaluated too often, because otherwise
the choices will be based on very few information. This will lead to
sub-optimal performance. On the other hand, if it is set too high, then your
system will take a long time to react to a change in access patterns.
</P>
<P>
The argument is in seconds or can be suffixed with an appropriate

Globule will traverse the entire content of your replicated web-site in
order to make sure backup servers have a full copy of your site. Normally
this is done as frequent as checking the availability of the replica

The <TT>GlobuleContentTraversalInterval</TT> directive specifies the delay (in

<P>
This directive is provided in case the content, or rather the number of files,
in your web-site grows very large. In case the server it not able to scan
all documents within the period of the HeartBeatInterval then you might want
to set the GlobuleContentTraversalInterval to a fair multiple of the time
required to scan the filesystem. This will not degrade the scanning whether
your files are up, just that the backup-server isn't being informed so often
of new files that have come into existance.
</P>
<P>
The argument is in seconds or can be suffixed with an appropriate
denominator. Specifying a <TT>GlobuleContentTraversalInterval</TT> value of 0
means that the filesystem will never be scanned. This can be used if no

With this directive you can specify that a non-Globule enabled server is to be

fetch the content from the origin server and configuration must be done
manually. The <I>url</I> is the address of the mirror-site, while the
<I>weight</I> has the same function as in a regular

</P>
<P>
Note that most of the advantages of Globule, such as consistency, merged
access logs and accounting are lost. Therefor the use of this directive is
highly discouraged. Globule will maintain the ability to use DNS redirection
and makes a minimal check on the availability of the mirror-based server such
to not redirect to a server which is obviously unavailable. It can not
however do a full check on the availability.

We encourage the use of normal Globule enabled replicas and do not actively

This directive does almost the same as the <A HREF="#GlobuleReplicaIs">GlobuleReplicaIs</A>

to redirect to. I.e. it is permanently held in the state of unavailable.
This can be used to test replica servers, as they can authorize themselves to
the origin server.
</P>
<P>
Using the GlobuleDisabledReplicaIs directive is similar, but not the same, as
defining a replica server with weight 0. We encourage using the weight as a
better way to take replica's out of the loop of available replica servers to
redirect to.

<P>
This directive can be used in conjunction with an origin site specification to
indicate that the server is an origin server, but the original documents do in
fact not really reside on this server. When the server is requested to serve
a document for which it (as an origin server!) has no longer a valid copy, it
will try to download the document from a third-party. This third-party
upstream server is not under a Globule controlled web-server. This approach
is somewhat similar to proxying, but then only for a single web-site.
</P>
<P>
The GlobuleProxyFor directive is used in the following way to make a copy of

<P>
When redirecting browsing users to one of the available replica servers, some
redirection policies have be ability to redirect more often to certain replica
servers than others. Each server is assigned a certain weight, servers with a
heavier weight are loaded with more requests than others.
</P>
<P>
The GlobuleOriginWeight directive assigns a weight to the origin server.
Optional parameters to GlobuleReplicaIs assign the weight of each of the
replica servers. By default the weight of each server is set to 1.
</P>
<P>
The value <I>weight</I> must be an integer ranging from 0 to 32767. The
default weight when not specified is 1. The weight parameters determin the
spread of the load over the available web-servers. If the weight of this
server is set at <I>n</I> and the sum of all the weights of all available servers
is <I>s</I> then the optimal load for this server is taken to be <I>n</I>/<I>s</I> of

<P>
Globule automatically responds to DNS queries for sections for which it is an
origin server or redirector and where DNS redirection is enabled. Any query
to the name specified in the ServerAlias<SUP><A NAME="text8" HREF="doc011.html#note8">8</A></SUP> such an exported section is responded by
with an A record of one or more available replica server. It is possible to
add more entries to Globule, such that it can also respond to certain other
queries with a fixed result. The GlobuleStaticResolv directive adds these
entries.
</P>
<P>
There are two possible entries which can be added, either A or CNAME DNS
record types. An A record points to the indicated IPv4 address. A CNAME
indicates an alias pointing to another Fully Qualified HostName (FQHN).
Unlike syntaxes like Bind, the FQHN specified here should not have an dot
appended to it and is never relative to another domain.<BR>
All dns-name's should be fully qualified hostnames, i.e. the hostname with the
domain name.
</P>
<P>
One possible use of this is to use Globule also to resolve the origin and
replica specific site-names. Normally one would have the <EM>specific</EM>
site-name in the ServerName, and the <EM>generic</EM> site-name which is
resolved by Globule as first in the ServerAlias. These <EM>specific</EM> site
names should be static addresses of the origin and replica sites. As such
they cannot be resolved by Globule itself and should be resolved by an
external nameserver. This is why Globule is made only the nameserver (NS
record) of the generic site, often www.<I>yourdomain</I>.<I>com</I>.
GlobuleStaticResolv does allow you to make Globule the authorative nameserver
of the entire domain by adding records like
origin.<I>yourdomain</I>.<I>com</I>. However you must remember that all
stand-alone redirectors must have the same data inserted into their
configuration.
